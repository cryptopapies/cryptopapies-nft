## 1. Introduction

Cryptopapies is a project made up of **7777** pixelated **"CryptoPapies"**, based on some of the most famous crypto and financial gurus out there.
A crypto papi is a figure representing a crypto/financial guru who sells products and courses to help "normal" people become rich as they are and who also has a lot of attractiveness, a kind of appeal to their audience.

The project's mission is to praise the rich man mindset, who should not feel ashamed for making money on others' beliefs. Being rich is not a matter of money, but of mindset. Cryptopapies will become a status symbol for people embracing the rich man mindset.

## 2. The Developer

Cryptopapies is being developed by a one-man team, made up of Christian Visintin, a Software Engineer, born in Trieste on May 30, 1997.
Since he was 14, he was really engaged in programming and in 2017 he got a job as a software developer.
Since then, he's really been curious about new technology and in 2022, he decided to approach blockchains and web3 and, so decided to start the cryptopapies project. At the beginning, it was just a joke between friends, but finally he decided to give it a try.

His favourite programming languages are Rust, Elixir and Python.

More information regarding the developer can be found on its website <https://veeso.github.io>

## 3. Roadmap

1. The public website is online
2. Development of the auto-generated NFTs engine
3. Creation of the first collection (the **Dubai Papi Collection**)
4. Once the first collection is sold, we'll arrange to create the first drop of the "Signature Collection" in partnership with a popular influencer in finance.
5. The second collection is dropped
6. Once 3333 NFTs are sold, CryptoPapies will donate 25% of their profits to support the most deserving independent open-source projects.
7. TBD

### 3.1 Long-term projects

1. Cryptopapies becomes a start-up involved in the spreading of the web3 credo.

## 4. NFTs

As stated in chapter 1, the NFT collection is made up of **7777** unique CryptoPapies, which can be divided into two categories:

### 4.1 auto-generated NFTs

**7000** of the total supply will be autogenerated by a Rust proprietary application, according to the NFT attributes. They will be totally random and unique. **This means there cannot be two or more cryptopapies with the same attributes**.

The following attributes are available for this category:

TBD

#### 4.1.1 auto-generated NFTs collections

All the auto-generated cryptopapies will be divided into collections with different charateristics:

1. The **Dubai Papi Collection** will be the first drop, with 1500 unique NFTs in the collection, representing papies making money in Dubai and flexing their fancy houses and luxury cars in the Arabic city.
2. The **Cryptoguru Collection** will be the second one, with 1500 unique NFTs, representing influencers making money with crypto trading and giving advice on Twitter.
3. The **Wall Street Prodige Collection**, with 500 unique NFTs, will be an old school collection of brokers in the 80's making money with stock trading in Wall St.
4. TBD (1500)
5. TBD (500)
6. TBD (500)
7. TBD 1000

### 4.2 Signed NFTs

The remaining **777** NFTs are reserved for the **Signature collection**. The signature collection won't include any auto-generated NFTs, instead, they will be hand painted, by an artist in collaboration with a financial guru, who will be involved in a partnership with the project.
Expect NFTs which belong to this collection to be released later, when the project will have reached a certain amount of people out there.

### 4.3 Rarity

Exception made for the "Signature Collection", there won't be any rarity associated to the auto-generated NFT, since in CryptoPapies we believe each NFT we supply, must be beautiful as the other. So no, we're not going to make scrap art.
